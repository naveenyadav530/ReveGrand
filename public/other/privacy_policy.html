            <h1>Welcome to our Privacy Policy</h1>
            <h3>Your privacy is critically important to us.</h3>
            Reve Grand is located at:<br />
            <address>
                Reve Grand Systems Kanina Khas, Haryana 123027<br /><br /> Email Us: <a
                    href="mailto:revegrandsystems@gmail.com">revegrandsystems@gmail.com</a>
            </address>

            <p>It is Reve Grand's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
                operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
                    href="https://revegrand.in">https://revegrand.in</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
                "https://revegrand.in"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
                information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
                Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and
                under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies
                only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information
                from other sources.</p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the general
                rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our
                Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

            <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
            <p>Like most website operators, Reve Grand collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
                web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
                referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Reve Grand's purpose in collecting
                non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Reve Grand's visitors use its
                website. From time to time, Reve Grand may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>Reve Grand also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://revegrand.in blog posts. Reve
                Grand only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
                and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Certain visitors to Reve Grand's websites choose to interact with Reve Grand in ways that require Reve
                Grand to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Reve Grand
                gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
                https://revegrand.in to provide a username and email address.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission
                over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
                acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>Advertisements</h2>
            <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows
                ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most
                interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Reve Grand and does not cover the use
                of cookies by any advertisers.</p>


            <h2>Links To External Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
            <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of
                any third party sites, products or services.</p>


            <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
            <p>Reve Grand discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
                those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information
                in order to process it on Reve Grand's behalf or to provide services available at Reve Grand's website,
                and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
                affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Reve Grand's website, you
                consent to the transfer of such information to them. Reve Grand will not rent or sell potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
                contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Reve Grand discloses potentially
                personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court
                order or other governmental request, or when Reve Grand believes in good faith that disclosure is
                reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Reve Grand, third parties or the public at
                large.</p>
            <p>If you are a registered user of https://revegrand.in and have supplied your email address, Reve Grand may
                occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
                up to date with what's going on with Reve Grand and our products. We primarily use our blog to
                communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send
                us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
                right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
                users. Reve Grand takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access,
                use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                information.</p>

            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p>Reve Grand may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Reve Grand may display
                this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Reve Grand does not disclose your
                personally-identifying information.</p>

            <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
            <p>This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your
                purchases or the price you may pay.</p>

            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Reve Grand uses "Cookies", similar technologies and
                services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your
                preferences on your computer.</p>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's
                browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Reve Grand uses cookies to help Reve
                Grand identify and track visitors, their usage of https://revegrand.in, and their website access
                preferences. Reve Grand visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set
                their browsers to refuse cookies before using Reve Grand's websites, with the drawback that certain
                features of Reve Grand's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and
                agree to Reve Grand's use of cookies.</p>



            <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Reve Grand may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
                and in Reve Grand's sole discretion. Reve Grand encourages visitors to frequently check this page for
                any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
                Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
